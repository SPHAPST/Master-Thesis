'''
The goal is to add vertices (or points) to a line feature at regular intervals (determined by the distLimit parameter) 
to improve label placement along the line. 
The new points are added to a "coordinateVector" list, which is used later to create a new object with the updated line geometry. 
This allows for more evenly spaced labels along the line feature, as opposed to just using the original vertices of the line.
Labels are placed at more consistent distances along the line, rather than clustering at certain areas or leaving large gaps at others

'''
HOW IT WORKS?
Try to find the location where the placement of the icon will cause the least disturbance to the background features, 
as measured by the sum of the values in the area covered by the icon. 
The minX and minY variables store the x and y coordinates of this location, respectively. 
Essentially, the code is moving the icon around the background and computing the sum of values under the icon for each location. 
It is then choosing the location where the sum of values is the smallest, 
as this location is assumed to cause the least disturbance to the background.
